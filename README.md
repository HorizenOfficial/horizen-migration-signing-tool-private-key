# Signing Tool with Private Key

## Overview

The **Signing Tool with Private Key** is a tool designed to generate cryptographic signatures required for claiming funds through a claim portal. Users can input specific details, and the tool outputs a valid signature for the claim message.

### Features

- **Private Key Input**:
  - Accepts private keys in **WIF format** or **HEX format**.
  - Allows specifying whether the public key uses the **compressed** or **uncompressed** setting, ensuring compatibility with early ZEN wallets that used uncompressed public keys.
- **Signature Generation**:
  - Inputs: Private key and destination address.
  - Output: A valid signature for the claim message, ready to be used on the claim portal.

### Technical Details

- Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
- The project output uses **static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files**, allowing the tool to run completely offline. This ensures that sensitive operations, such as handling private keys, remain secure and confined to the user's local environment.
